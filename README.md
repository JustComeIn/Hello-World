# Hello-World
Trying to learn how to expand my coding

My name is Joe and I am 51 yo, live in AVegas and currently goint to school for Graphic Design.  All I know about coding is when I took a class in Basic back in like 1983!  haha  I was pretty good with that and using DOS but when Windows came out I was a bit confused so gave it up.  Moving on through life and several marriages later, I decided to learn Graphic Design and specifically Web Development.  The design part isn't that difficult and I know intermediate HTML and CSS.  Web Development, on the otherhand is a whole new ballgame.  So many languages, systems and plateforms to learn.  So I want to see what I can do and if it is right for me.  I was told Git was the way to go so here I am.

Thus far, I have no idea what I want to try to write but when that time comes, this file will be updated.
